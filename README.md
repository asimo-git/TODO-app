This habit and task tracker is based on a method that divides all tasks into three categories:
* **Tasks**- one-time actions scheduled for a specific date
* **Habits** - recurring actions with a set frequency
* **Heaps** - actions that need to be completed a specific number of times without being tied to a specific date or interval

The online version of the application is available at [todo-6vlm6qmyk-asimo-gits-projects.vercel.app/](https://todo-6vlm6qmyk-asimo-gits-projects.vercel.app/)
The priority of tasks in the list is determined by font size.
May discipline be with you!
